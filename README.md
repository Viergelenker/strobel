# Strobel website
This project is going to be the new webpage for a company called Strobel, based in Ludwigsburg, Germany.  
I decided to use spring-boot as the core framework, since i'm more experienced with it than angular.js or similar and i have the oppertunity to build a whole web application later on.
The current working state is deployed on heroku.com, which let's you easily have a look if you'd like to.

Since i'm using a free dyne right now, the server goes to standby after 30 minutes, so please be patient for the first request:
